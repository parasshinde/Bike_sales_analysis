Bike Sales Analytics Dashboard

Transformed a raw dataset (1,000+ records, 15 fields) into a clean, interactive Excel dashboard to uncover key bike purchase trends.

What I did:

Cleaned and standardized data using Power Query.

Engineered features like income and commute bands for better segmentation.

Analyzed key drivers (income, region, commute, marital status) using pivot tables and charts.

Built a one-page dashboard with slicers and visuals (bar, donut, KPI cards).

Ensured usability with tooltips, drill-downs, and clear visual hierarchy.

Impact:

Identified top customer segments (e.g., $60K+ income, 30–45 km commute).

Revealed high-income buyers are 2.4× more likely to purchase.

Cut ad-hoc reporting time by 80%.
